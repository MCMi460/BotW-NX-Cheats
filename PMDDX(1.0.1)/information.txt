# Information I've worked to collect

Yeah so I haven't made any real cheats just yet since I didn't feel like putting in effort, but I have made some progress. 

I don't know everything about how this game works yet, but I can tell you that when in a mystery dungeon your level and EVs/IVs are all static. They are all on the base values, so cool. 

Level value location (when in mystery dungeon): [BASE+0xabb7662a0]
It's 32-bit and unsigned. 

The level cap is the same as the other games, so it's lvl100. Just use SXCheatTool or something to make a code. I don't have any time right now, so there's the most information I've got for you.

Use PKHex for data calculating on finding out realistic EVs to change values to properly. I seriously cannot type in full and correct sentences right now. Time for me to go, bye.
