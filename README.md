<h2><b>NX Cheats Disclaimer</b></h2>

<p4>A collection of Nintendo Switch cheats - I did not code most of these. These are all for custom firmware users, so please educate yourself on the use of </p4><a href="https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Main_Page">homebrew</a><p4> before writing an issue. I have not tested all of these codes, so if any of these cheats do not operate properly, please write an issue in GitHub. I am not to be put at fault if any cheat codes damage your game or get you banned. Basic common sense should be applied when cheating:
A) If it gives you an unfair advantage (effectively all of the cheats), don't bring it online.
B) Keep saves to prevent mishaps.</p4>
